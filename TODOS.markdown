#### TODO
- AnnealedNoise + forward Kl does not work
- test if other energy functions work as intended
- add rand nodes to forwardkl and ppo

### TODO PPO and forward_KL
- make sure every env sample is used at least once
- make code faster with scanner?

### TODO categorical Conditional Expectation??

### TODO add random node features to PPO and forward_KL


### TODO remove padded graph in forward KL
### TODO use rand choise in RL and forward KL

### TODO TSP
- add graph node features and edge features to input
- add positional embeddings on edges and nodes
- add GAT

### TODO test if energy is even correct
